## 📖 What is ShipIt365?  
ShipIt365 is my year-long challenge to **design, develop, and deploy 300+ diverse software projects** — all powered by creativity, problem-solving, and AI-assisted coding.  
The goal? To build a portfolio that **proves my skills, versatility, and ability to ship production-ready projects fast**.

This repository is the **central hub** for all my work — from quick micro-projects to complex full-stack applications. Every project is fully documented, live-hosted, and available for review.
